### Project: BookFace

BookFace replaces a paper-based system or manual tracking of books and patrons, providing greater speed/efficiency to librarians. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12.6 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
